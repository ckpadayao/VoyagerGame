To use npm, you have to download node.js. Preferably the latest version.

To run in localhost:3000, use npm run start (start command is found in package.json). Routes like /addSubtract and /studentSignUp won't work otherwise.

Things might not work correctly also, if you don't install the following things on your local terminal. You can also run the terminal through VS Studio (commands included):

    npm install express
    npm install body-parser
    npm install csrf
    npm install cookie-parser
    npm install firebase
    npm install firebase-auth
    npm install @firebase/firestore
